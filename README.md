# Intro to React Native

A small application that demos the basic React Native components as well as some native functionality using Expo.

## Setup

`npm i`

`npx expo start` - Requires you to be on the same WiFi on your phone and computer
`npx expo start --tunnel` - Sets up a tunnel so that your app and ExpoGo don't need to be on the same WiFi
